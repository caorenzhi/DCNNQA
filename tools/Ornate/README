Ornate is a method for protein quality assessment.

To install Ornate:
    -Install Python 3.5 or later
    -Install Tensorflow (preferably with GPU support) from https://www.tensorflow.org/install
    -Uncomment the line corresponding to your operating system in the "config" file

To run Ornate:
    You can score one structure :
    python score.py -s path/to/my_structure.pdb
    or all structures in a directory : 
    python score.py -d path/to/my_directory

To interpret output:
    The output in generally composed of multiple lines, each line correspond to one residue.
    A typical line output is :
    RES  107 L 0.4041
    which means that the residue 107 from the input is a leucine and its score is 0.4041.
    A high score should correspond to a well folded residue.

Feel free to modify the script score.py to match your needs
